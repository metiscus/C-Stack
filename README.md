# C-Stack
This is a very simple c based stack with included unit tests. The test suite code is probably more interesting than the actual library code itself.

This project could be useful as a reference for those new to writing libraries, working with the c language, or learning how to write makefiles although it should not be considered authoritative for those purposes.
